In order to run your program you will need to download Anvil, which lets you run a server on your computer.

Once you download it, if your computer doesn't want to open it, right click on the application and select "open."

Make sure your anvil server is on when viewing the examples and working on your assignment. Once you add your project folder to Anvil, you'll be able to access your program at http://images.dev
